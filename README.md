**Tension between particles computed with this formula:**
```math
\text{TENSION} = \frac{\text{INITIAL LENGTH} - \text{CURRENT LENGTH}}{\text{CURRENT LENGTH}}
```
**OR:**
```math
\text{TENSION} = \frac{\text{INITIAL LENGTH} - \text{NEW LENGTH}}{\text{NEW LENGTH}}
```
# DEMONSTRATION
**Blue colored -1 ≤ tension < 0, Black colored tension = 0 and Red colored 0 > tension ≥ 1:**
