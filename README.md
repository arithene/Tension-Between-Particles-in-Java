**Tension between particles computed with this formula:**
```math
\text{TENSION} = \frac{\text{INITIAL LENGTH} - \text{CURRENT LENGTH}}{\text{CURRENT LENGTH}}
```
**OR:**
```math
\text{TENSION} = \frac{\text{INITIAL LENGTH} - \text{NEW LENGTH}}{\text{NEW LENGTH}}
```
# DEMONSTRATION
**$${\color{blue}BLUE}$$ tension between -1 and 0, $${\color{gray}BLACK}$$ tension equal to 0, $${\color{red}RED}$$ tension between 0 and 1,:**
